# Digit-Recognizer

This is a project that can be found in the website Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer.

The goal is to identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.

The model "jtsai_model.h5" is generated by the training process in <a href="https://github.com/LightAN21/Digit-Recognizer/blob/master/testing_2.ipynb">testing_2.ipynb</a>.

"42-jtsai-2.csv" is the identification result of the dataset given in the website Kaggle, generated by the model "jtsai_model.h5".

The score "0.98942" in the image <a href="https://github.com/LightAN21/Digit-Recognizer/blob/master/My_Kaggle_Digit_Recognizer_score.png">My_Kaggle_Digit_Recognizer_score.png</a> is the correct recognition rate of the submission using "42-jtsai-2.csv".
